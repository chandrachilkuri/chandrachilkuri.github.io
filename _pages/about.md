[Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) Advertising](https://www.wbd.com/warner-bros-discovery-showcases-impressive-slate-advertising-solutions-content-offerings-and) offers innovative, data-driven solutions across premium entertainment, sports, news, and lifestyle brands, empowering partners to reach audiences at scale. With iconic IP and cutting-edge platforms like Max, WBD drives measurable results and cultural impact for advertisers worldwide. I am a seasoned Data Engineer with extensive experience in building scalable data systems, while leveraging AI/ML techniques to drive impactful business outcomes and optimize data-driven solutions.


**Bio:**  Driven by a passion for data-driven insights and scalable solutions, I bring a diverse background in both academic research and industry applications to the field of AI/ML/NLP. My foundation in data science was cultivated through Master of Science in Applied Data Science at Indiana University and Master of Science in Information Technology (Online) at University of Cumberlands, where I focused on advanced data science methodologies, including predictive analytics, distributed computing, statistical modeling, and neural networks.

My professional experience at Warner Bros. Discovery further solidified my expertise, where I enhanced ad targeting models using collaborative filtering, leading to a significant increase in digital ad revenue. This was amplified by leading a team to design real-time ad analytics solutions using AWS Bedrock and LLMs, recognized as a top innovation within the company. This hands-on work along with other professional experiences has provided me with in-depth practical knowledge of machine learning model building, data pipeline design, data analytics, and NLP. Now, I am eager to leverage this experience and pursue advanced research at a thesis level, focusing on scalable algorithms, data-driven insights, and impactful applications in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.


**Impact:** My academic research at Indiana University involved developing innovative systems for full-body interaction and optimizing healthcare data flows, improving operational efficiency by 30%. This foundation in data-driven problem-solving propelled my professional career at Warner Bros. Discovery, where I enhanced ad targeting models using collaborative filtering, contributing to a $330 million increase in digital ad revenue. Furthermore, my leadership in architecting the [Olli](https://www.wbd.com/warner-bros-discovery-announces-olli-new-first-party-data-platform-powering-converged-audience-solutions) data platform improved customer matching precision by 75%. The scalable data pipelines I streamlined have reduced processing latency by 50%, showcasing my ability to create impactful solutions in both academic and industry settings.

**Future Plans:** My current work is focused on developing scalable Machine Learning algorithms and architectures with an emphasis on multimodal learning and dialogue systems. My intention is to leverage my data engineering and machine learning skills to construct scalable machine learning pipelines. My focus will be building robust and accurate systems, while contributing to the open-source community, through publishing my work externally. My efforts in this direction include:

Scalable Machine Learning Infrastructure: Designing and implementing a distributed architecture for training large-scale deep learning models on an AWS cluster.

Advanced Data Visualization: Integrating advanced interactive visualization techniques to explore, explain and interpret large scale data.

Open-Source Contribution: Intend to contribute high impact, high quality code in the data engineering and machine learning space.
